Hello there, fellow programming student  
You have stumbled upon my CS1101S repo, where I store the code I wrote while taking CS1101S  
Feel free to look around and take inspiration from it   
If you are also taking CS1101S, I hope this repo helps you better understand the concepts taught in CS1101S

# CS1101S AY25/26 SEM 1
Hello there, fellow programming student  
You have stumbled upon my CS1101S repo, where I store the code I wrote while taking CS1101S  
Feel free to look around and take inspiration from it   
If you are also taking CS1101S, I hope this repo helps you better understand the concepts taught in CS1101S  
CS1101S is a functional programming module offered by School of Computing, National University of Singapore  
CS1101S is primarily based off the SICP textbook and is taught in Source, a programming language that is a subset of JavaScript  
The owner of this repo took CS1101S in AY 25/26 Semester 1

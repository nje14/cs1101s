//i dont get how this module expects people to figure this out on their own
//other than prior knowledge so please forgive me ;-;
//i would provide the chat log but i wasnt logged in (i didnt have a openai account prior to this)
//and the chat log wasnt saved 
//i asked chatgpt mainly on what was happening

//i also did consult my avenger on what was happening
